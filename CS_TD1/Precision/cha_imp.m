% solves the heat equation u_t = D u_xx on [0,2*pi] with initial data u_0 =
% sin(k x) with periodic boundary conditions using finite-differences in
% space and implicit time-stepping.  t_0 is the initial time, t_f is the
% final time, N is the number of intervals in space, and M is the number of
% intervals in time.  err is the error.
