function v = tridiagLUSolve(d,a,e,f,v)
% tridiagLUsolve  Solve (LU)*v = d where L and U are LU factors of a tridiagonal
%                 matrix
%
% Synopsis:  v = tridiagLUsolve(d,e,f)
%            v = tridiagLUsolve(d,e,f,v)
%
% Input:   d = right hand side vector of the system of equatoins
%        e,f = vectors defining the L and U factors of the tridiagonal matrix.
%              e and f are obtained with the tridiagLU function
%          v = solution vector.  If v is supplied, the elements of v are over-
%              written (thereby saving the memory allocation step).  If v is not
%              supplied, it is created.  v is used as a scratch vector in the
%              forward solve.
%
% Output: v = solution vector
n = length(d);
if nargin<5,  v = zeros(n,1);  end
% --- Forward substitution to solve L*w = d
v(1) = d(1)/e(1);
for i=2:n

% --- Backward substitution to solve U*v = w
for i=n-1:-1:1
v(i) = v(i) - f(i)*v(i+1);
